- **Background**
I am a die-cast model car collector. I have nearlly 500 model cars collction in my room. Recently I have a issue that I cannot keep in track on all of my collections and sometimes I bougth the same car just because I forgot I had bought it. As a result, I have a lot of duplicate cars that I do not even notice. In order to solve this problem, I came up wth a idea that I can have a program, which promt me to enter detailed information, like brand , menufacture, car category, image...., about the car after I purchase it. So that I can have my own data base of my collection. Not only I keep track on all of my collections, I will never purchase same car again.
- **Conceptual Design**
A Java program that lined to database and able to return the object that fits the category. And the user are making request by category in order to find objects that are in common. The project is important since it can increase the porductivity of a person, especially when the person have a lot of objects that need to be categorized.
- **Project Relevance**
This database can be used on various of applications including educationl purpose. For instance, program designer can categorize their projects, instructors are able to find students' submisstion by referencing category...
