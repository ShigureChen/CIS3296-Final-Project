- **Background**

I am a die-cast model car collector. I have nearly 500 model cars collection in my room. Recently I had an issue that I cannot keep in track on all my collections and sometimes I bought the same car just because I forgot I had bought it. As a result, I have a lot of duplicate cars that I do not even notice. In order to solve this problem, I came up with an idea that I can have a program, which prompt me to enter detailed information, like brand, manufacturer, car category, image...., about the car after I purchase it. So that I can have my own data base of my collection. Not only I keep track on all my collections, but I will also never purchase same car again.

- **Conceptual Design**

I decided to use WordPress as a user interface of website and MariaDB as database of my server. A Java program that runs in webserver and linked to database, so this program is able to return the object that fits the category. And the user is making request by category in order to find objects that are in common. The project is important since it can increase the productivity of a person, especially when the person have a lot of objects that need to be categorized.

- **Project Relevance**

The reason why this data base project is relevant to the objective of software design course is that it involves object-oriented programing skills, TTD, version control and debugging. After building this project, I can learn a lot of details in software design. On top of that, this database can be used on various of applications including educational purpose. For instance, program designer can categorize their projects, instructors are able to find students' submission by referencing category.
